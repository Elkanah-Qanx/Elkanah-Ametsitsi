# Our Mission,Vision and Value

#### Our Mission

To build the world’s most comprehensive, real-time sound map by leveraging decentralized infrastructure, empowering individuals to reclaim their auditory well-being and drive effective policy change against noise pollution.

#### Our Vision

We envision a world where every citizen has transparent, verifiable data on the sound environment around them, leading to quieter, healthier, and more productive urban spaces worldwide. We aim to become the universal, community-driven standard for environmental noise monitoring.

<table><thead><tr><th>Value </th><th width="162.99993896484375">Principle</th><th>How We Live This Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Decentralization</td><td>Ownership and Autonomy</td><td>We believe the most valuable data is created and owned by the community. We use distributed ledger technology (like Hedera) to ensure transparency, security, and immutability, ensuring no single entity controls the global sound map.</td></tr><tr><td>Integrity &#x26; Accuracy</td><td>Verifiable Truth</td><td>We prioritize the quality and integrity of our environmental data. We employ sensor validation and cryptographic proof to ensure every submitted noise report is an accurate, trustworthy reflection of the real-world soundscape.</td></tr><tr><td>Empowerment</td><td>Incentivized Action</td><td>We transform passive exposure to noise into active participation in the solution. We utilize GameFi principles to reward users for their environmental contributions, making environmental stewardship accessible, engaging, and valuable.</td></tr><tr><td>Auditory Wellness</td><td>Health First</td><td>We recognize noise pollution as a major public health crisis. Our core focus is on providing actionable insights that enable people, planners, and organizations to mitigate noise, thereby fostering better sleep, reduced stress, and improved cognitive function.</td></tr><tr><td>Transparency</td><td>Open Data for Good</td><td>The data we collect is a public resource. We commit to making the resulting noise map accessible and easy to interpret, driving informed decision-making for urban development, real estate, and public health policy.</td></tr></tbody></table>
