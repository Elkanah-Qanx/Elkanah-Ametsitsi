# Noise Level Threshold

## Noise Pollution Thresholds in Africa

The legal and recommended thresholds for noise pollution in Africa are diverse, though many countries use the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines as a reference point for setting their national and local regulations.

**HushSense's noise monitoring strategy**, when operating within African countries, we follow a hybrid approach that integrates the strict public health goals of the World Health Organization (WHO) with the enforceable legal limits of national and municipal African regulations.

The core challenge for any noise monitoring service in this region, as highlighted by the need for compliance, is that local regulations often permit noise levels that the WHO classifies as harmful to human health.

### 1. World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines (Reference)

The WHO guidelines are often cited as the aspirational healthy threshold. They aim to prevent serious annoyance and sleep disturbance.

| Environment                | Time Period                     | Recommended Threshold (LAeq, dBA)       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Residential (Outdoor)**  | Daytime (e.g., 06:00 – 22:00)   | **55 dBA** (To avoid serious annoyance) |
| **Residential (Outdoor)**  | Nighttime (e.g., 22:00 – 06:00) | **45 dBA** (To avoid sleep disturbance) |
| **Indoor (Bedrooms)**      | Nighttime                       | **30 dBA**                              |
| **Schools & Classrooms**   | Indoor                          | **35 dBA**                              |
| **Occupational/Workplace** | 8-hour workday exposure         | **85 dBA** (U.S. NIOSH standard)        |

### 2. Examples of Specific African Country Regulations

African nations like Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa have established specific regulations, often differentiating limits based on the land-use zone (residential, commercial, industrial, and mixed-use).

#### Nigeria (NESREA Regulations)

Nigeria's National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA) has detailed standards.

| Zone Category   | Time Period | Maximum Permissible Limit (LAeq, dBA) |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Residential** | Daytime     | 55 dBA                                |
| **Residential** | Nighttime   | 45 dBA                                |
| **Commercial**  | Daytime     | 65 dBA                                |
| **Industrial**  | Daytime     | 90 dBA                                |

_Note: For construction, noise levels must not exceed the ambient noise level of a nearby facility (e.g., residential area) by more than 5 dBA._

#### Kenya (NEMA Regulations)

Kenya's National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) regulations also distinguish limits by zone:

| Zone Category            | Time Period    | Maximum Permissible Limit (LAeq, dBA) |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Residential**          | Daytime        | 50-55 dBA                             |
| **Residential**          | Nighttime      | 35-45 dBA                             |
| **Commercial/Mixed-use** | DaytimeDaytime | 60-75 dBA                             |
| **Industrial**           | Daytime        | 75-80 dBA                             |

#### South Africa (Provincial/Local Regulations)

In South Africa, noise control is handled at the provincial and local level, but general guidelines often define a "disturbing noise" as:

* Noise that exceeds the ambient (residual) sound level by **more than 7 dBA** (Western Cape Regulation) or **more than 5 dBA** (Free State Regulation).
* Typical reference levels for residential areas often align with the WHO, such as **55 dBA for day-time** and **45 dBA for night-time**.

### 3. The Challenge of Enforcement and Reality

While the established thresholds look comparable to international standards, the primary issue across many large African cities (like Lagos, Nairobi, and Cairo) is **enforcement and compliance**.

* **High Ambient Noise:** Actual measured noise levels in high-density urban areas frequently **exceed 70 dBA or even 90 dBA** due to constant traffic, generators, loud markets, construction, and public address systems.
* **Health Impact:** This consistently high exposure is why noise pollution is recognized as a significant public health issue in many African urban centers, impacting sleep, concentration, and long-term health.
