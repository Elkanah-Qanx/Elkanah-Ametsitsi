# Our Reward System

### The $HUSH Reward System: Prioritizing Integrity and Discovery

The $HUSH reward system is engineered to foster a high-quality, trustworthy DePIN network. Unlike traditional models that simply reward volume, we reward context, integrity, and the strategic placement of monitoring nodes.

The system is built on one core principle: We reward data quality and strategic coverage, not raw decibel counts.

#### 1. The Principle of Integrity Over Volume

We understand the misconception: "The noisier my area, the more $HUSH I earn." That's incorrect. Rewarding for high noise levels would incentivize users to actively seek out or even create noise pollution which is antithetical to our mission.

Instead, the reward model flips this notion on its head:

**The Quiet Discovery Multiplier (QDM)**

The most valuable contribution you can make is confirming the acoustic baseline of an environment. By running your node in a stable, compliant (quiet) zone for extended periods, you establish a reliable reference point for that location.

* How it Works: Monitoring sessions that consistently report noise levels below the established local compliance threshold (e.g., 55 $$ $\text{dB(A)}$ $$ at night) earn a Quiet Discovery Multiplier (QDM). The QDM boosts your baseline $HUSH rewards for that session, as this data confirms compliance and helps us map the "healthy" soundscape of the city.
* The Incentive: This mechanic directly encourages integrity. It rewards honest, long-duration monitoring sessions in typical residential and public areas, rather than brief bursts in loud, chaotic spots.

#### 2. Core Reward Pillars

Your base $HUSH rewards are calculated daily based on three key contribution pillars:

| Network Availability (Uptime)         | The most fundamental reward. This tracks how long your smartphone node is active, connected to the network, and submitting packets of validated, anonymized data. | Rewards for consecutive, long-duration sessions (e.g., sessions over 8 hours receive a time-based bonus).                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strategic Coverage (Geospatial Value) | This measures the uniqueness and demand for your location's data. If you are the first or only node covering a critical but unmapped area, your value increases.  | Geospatial Bonus: Higher rewards for operating in under-represented census blocks, especially near areas of known compliance concern (e.g., industrial zones, transit hubs) where data is scarce. |
|  Data Fidelity (Quality & Integrity)  | This ensures your data stream is stable, consistent, and passes all AI validation checks (e.g., zero privacy flags, accurate GPS lock, minimal sensor tampering). | Integrity Streak Bonus: Higher $HUSH rewards for nodes that maintain a perfect data integrity record over a 7-day or 30-day period.                                                               |
