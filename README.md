# HushSense Docs

HushSense is a DePIN project that aims to solve the problem of urban noise pollution, which is a significant public health and economic issue. The project's vision is to build the world's largest and most accurate real-time noise map by using a decentralized community of smartphone users.

We have all been there. You're trying to enjoy a quiet coffee, but the cafe is so loud you can barely think. You book a hotel room hoping for a peaceful night's sleep, only to be kept awake by street noise. You want to file a complaint about the construction site that starts at 6 AM every morning, but there's no easy way to do it.

These everyday frustrations point to a bigger problem: noise pollution is everywhere, affecting our health, sleep, and quality of life yet we have almost no reliable data about it.
