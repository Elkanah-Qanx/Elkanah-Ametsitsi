# Hush Token Distribution

## HushSense Tokenomics: $HUSH Distribution Plan

The $HUSH token distribution is designed to prioritize **long-term network sustainability, decentralized growth, and the rewarding of high-integrity contributions** over several decades. Our model places the vast majority of tokens directly into the hands of the community that builds and maintains the Soundscape network.

### Token Supply Overview

| **Total Supply**                     | **50 Billion $HUSH**    | A large supply ensures adequate granularity for micro-rewards (Quiet Discovery Multipliers) and guarantees a sufficiently long emission schedule to sustain the network. |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Initial Circulating Supply (TGE)** | **10 M  $HUSH (0.02%)** | This volume supports immediate liquidity, TGE events, and initial community bootstrapping.                                                                               |

### $HUSH Token Allocation (100% of Total Supply)

The 50 Billion $HUSH total supply is distributed across four core pools. The largest share is dedicated to rewarding the community for providing validated soundscape data.

| Allocation Pool                         | Percentage of Total Supply | Amount (Billion $HUSH) | Purpose and Vesting                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. DePIN Rewards Pool**               | 7**0.0%**                  | **35.0 B**             | Incentivizes data collection, integrity, and network coverage. This pool funds the **Quiet Discovery Multiplier (QDM)**. _Emitted dynamically via a predetermined schedule (e.g., halving every 2 years)._ |
| **2. Initial Circulating Supply (TGE)** | &#x30;**.02%**             | **10.0 M**             | Provides immediate liquidity, conducts the token generation event (TGE), and funds initial community incentives. _Fully unlocked at TGE._                                                                  |
| **3. Foundation & Ecosystem**           | **19.98%**                 | &#x39;**.99 B**        | Funds strategic partnerships, developer grants, security audits, and long-term network governance. _Vested linearly over 60 months (5 years)._                                                             |
| **4. Team & Advisors**                  | **10.0%**                  | **5.0 B**              | Rewards the core team and strategic advisors for their foundational work and long-term commitment. _Subject to a 12-month cliff, then vested linearly over 36 months._                                     |
| **TOTAL**                               | **100%**                   | **50.0 B**             |                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Detailed Breakdown: Initial Circulating Supply (10 Billion $HUSH)

The 10 Billion $HUSH released at the Token Generation Event (TGE) is allocated to ensure a stable market launch and immediate community engagement.

| Initial Supply Component               | Percentage of Initial Supply | Amount (Billion $HUSH) | Function                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public Sale / Launchpad**            | 50%                          | 5.0 M                  | Raising initial capital and maximizing distribution to a broad base of supporters.                                        |
| **Decentralized Liquidity Pool (DLP)** | 30%                          | 3.0 M                  | Ensuring robust liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and initial listings.                                         |
| **Community Airdrop & Pioneers**       | 20%                          | 2.0 M                  | Rewarding early testers, strategic Soundscape First-Movers, and marketing initiatives to bootstrap network participation. |

### Emission and Vesting Schedules

The token distribution strategy includes rigorous vesting and a dynamic emission curve to prevent market volatility and ensure the long-term health of the network.

#### DePIN Rewards Emission

The 30 Billion $HUSH allocated to the DePIN Rewards Pool is the lifeblood of the network and is designed for longevity.

* **Mechanism:** Rewards are earned by contributors daily in real-time, based on their validated data contributions and integrity scores.
* **Emission Epochs and Decay:** The total annual emission rate will decay or **"halve" every two years**, similar to Bitcoin's model. However, the reward release schedule is managed in **six-month epochs**. This means the specific reward rate ($HUSH$ per data contribution unit) is calculated and locked in for a fixed 6-month period, providing predictability and stability for contributors, while the 2-year decay ensures the reward pool sustains operations for over 20 years. This encourages rapid network deployment in the early stages.

#### Team and Foundation Vesting

To align the interests of the core team and the foundation with the long-term success of HushSense, these tokens are subject to a lock-up period:

| Allocation                 | Vesting Schedule                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Team & Advisors**        | **12-Month Cliff** (no tokens released), followed by **Linear Vesting** over the subsequent **36 months**.                                       |
| **Foundation & Ecosystem** | **Linear Vesting** over **60 months** (5 years), ensuring the foundation has capital to pursue long-term goals and react to market developments. |

This distribution plan ensures that $HUSH$ is primarily a utility token, earned through verifiable, high-integrity data contribution, while maintaining a clear and stable financial roadmap for the project's development.
